# (REACT To My) Portfolio!

## Description

Welcome to my very first portfolio made with React! In my portfolio you will find my most recent projects, an about me page, a resume page, and finally a contact page. I will also have links on the bottom that will take you directly to my LinkedIn page, as well as my Github Repos!
